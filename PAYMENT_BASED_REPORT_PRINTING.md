## Implementation Details

### 1. CollectDueModal.tsx - Enhanced Payment Collection

**Changes:**
- Added user role detection (SUDO, ADMIN, RECEPTION)
- RECEPTION: Can only mark full payment
- SUDO/ADMIN: Can enter any amount
- Added role-specific help text

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
const isAdminOrSudo = user?.role === 'SUDO' || user?.role === 'ADMIN';
const isReception = user?.role === 'RECEPTION';

// For RECEPTION: only allow full payment
if (isReception && amountPaid !== visit.due_amount) {
    alert(`As Reception, you can only mark the full amount of ₹${visit.due_amount.toFixed(2)} as paid.`);
    return;
}

// For ADMIN/SUDO: allow any amount
if (!isAdminOrSudo && amountPaid > visit.due_amount) {
    alert(`Amount paid cannot be more than the due amount...`);
    return;
}
```

**UI Enhancements:**
- Shows role-specific help text
- Input field max value for non-admin users
- Clear instructions for each role

### 2. CreateVisitForm.tsx - Report Printing Logic

**SuccessDisplay Component:**
- Shows payment status (Fully Paid / Partial/Unpaid)
- Shows clear message about report printing eligibility
- B2B clients see "Report can be printed immediately"
- Direct patients see payment requirement message

**Recent Registrations Table:**
- Updated button logic with better tooltips
- Shows "Print Report" for eligible visits
- Shows "Collect Due & Print" for unpaid visits
- Shows "Awaiting Approval" for unapproved tests
