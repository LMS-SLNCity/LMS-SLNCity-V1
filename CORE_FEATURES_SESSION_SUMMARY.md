# Core Features Development Session Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Branch:** `feature/core-features` (created from `main`)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

---

## What We Did

### 1. ‚úÖ Separated Branch Isolation Work
- **Moved** all branch isolation work to `feature/branch-isolation` branch
- **Created** clean `feature/core-features` branch from `main`
- **Reason:** Branch isolation was adding complexity; core features need focus first

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Referral Doctor Management
**Issue:** Referral doctors couldn't be added  
**Root Cause:** Missing auth middleware on POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoints  
**Fix:**
- Added `authMiddleware` to write operations
- Added `requirePermission(['MANAGE_B2B'])` check
- Added input validation for doctor name
- Added console logging for debugging

**File:** `/server/src/routes/referralDoctors.ts`

### 3. ‚úÖ Implemented PDF Export for Reports
**Issue:** Reports used browser print() which included unwanted headers/footers  
**Solution:**
- Installed `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` packages
- Created PDF download button in ReportModal
- Implemented multi-page PDF support
- Added loading state during export
- PDF filename includes visit code and date

**Files Modified:**
- `/components/ReportModal.tsx` - Added PDF export functionality
- `/package.json` - Added dependencies

**Features:**
- Clean PDF without browser UI elements
- Automatic page breaks for long reports
- Professional formatting
- Download with meaningful filename

### 4. ‚úÖ Implemented Real QR Codes
**Issue:** QR codes were placeholder SVGs, not scannable  
**Solution:**
- Installed `qrcode.react` package
- Replaced placeholder SVG with real QR code
- QR code links to `/verify-report/{visit_code}`
- High error correction level (H) for reliability

**File:** `/components/TestReport.tsx`

**Features:**
- Scannable QR codes on every report
- Links to report verification endpoint
- Professional appearance
- Better error recovery
