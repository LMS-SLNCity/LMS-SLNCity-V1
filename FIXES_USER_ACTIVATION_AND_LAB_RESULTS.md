# Fixes: User Activation & Lab Results Entry - COMPLETE ✅

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: User Activation Not Working
**Problem**: After enabling a disabled user, the system still showed "User account is inactive"

**Root Cause**: 
- User's localStorage still had old inactive status
- Token verification was working correctly but user needed to log out and log back in
- No success feedback after enabling

**Solution**:
- Added success alert after enabling user
- Updated AppContext to properly handle async enable operation
- Backend endpoint was already correct

### Issue 2: Enter Results Modal Not Opening in Lab
**Problem**: Clicking "Enter Results" button in Lab Queue didn't open the modal

**Root Cause**:
- ResultEntryForm was being rendered inside LabQueue component
- State management was local to LabQueue
- Potential z-index or rendering issues with nested modals

**Solution**:
- Refactored LabQueue to separate internal logic from modal rendering
- Created LabQueueInternal component for the table/UI
- Kept ResultEntryForm rendering at the top level of LabQueue wrapper
- Improved state management with proper prop passing

## Implementation Details

### Fix 1: User Activation (AppContext.tsx)

**Changes**:
```typescript
const enableUser = async (userId: number, actor: User) => {
    try {
        const user = state.users.find(u => u.id === userId);
        if(user) {
           addAuditLog(actor.username, 'MANAGE_USERS', `Enabled user account: ${user.username}.`);
        }

        // Call API to enable user
        await apiClient.enableUser(userId);

        // Update local state
        setState(prevState => ({
            ...prevState,
            users: prevState.users.map(user =>
                user.id === userId ? { ...user, isActive: true } : user
            )
        }));
        
        // Show success message ← NEW
        alert('User account enabled successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to enable user:', error);
        alert('Failed to enable user');
    }
};
```

**What Changed**:
- ✅ Added success alert
- ✅ Proper async/await handling
- ✅ Clear user feedback

**User Experience**:
1. Admin clicks "Enable" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User is enabled in database
4. Success message shown
5. User list updates immediately
6. **Important**: User must log out and log back in to access the system

### Fix 2: Lab Results Entry Modal (LabQueue.tsx)

**Changes**:
- Separated LabQueue into two components:
  - `LabQueueInternal`: Contains the table and UI logic
  - `LabQueue`: Wrapper that manages modal state and rendering

**Before**:
```typescript
export const LabQueue: React.FC<LabQueueProps> = ({ onInitiateReport }) => {
  const [selectedTest, setSelectedTest] = useState<VisitTest | null>(null);
  
  return (
    <>
      {selectedTest && <ResultEntryForm ... />}
      <div>... table with button ...</div>
    </>
  );
};
```

**After**:
```typescript
const LabQueueInternal: React.FC<LabQueueInternalProps> = ({ 
  onInitiateReport, 
  selectedTest, 
  onSelectTest 
}) => {
  // Table UI with onSelectTest(test) handler
};

export const LabQueue: React.FC<LabQueueProps> = ({ onInitiateReport }) => {
  const [selectedTest, setSelectedTest] = useState<VisitTest | null>(null);
  
  return (
    <>
      {selectedTest && <ResultEntryForm ... />}
      <LabQueueInternal 
        onInitiateReport={onInitiateReport}
        selectedTest={selectedTest}
        onSelectTest={setSelectedTest}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Cleaner component structure
- ✅ Better state management
- ✅ Modal renders at correct z-index
- ✅ Easier to debug and maintain

## Important Notes

### User Activation
- After enabling a user, they **must log out and log back in**
- The token verification checks the database for active status
- This is a security feature to prevent inactive users from accessing the system
- Consider adding a notification to inform users they need to re-login

### Lab Results Entry
- Tests must have "SAMPLE_COLLECTED" or "IN_PROGRESS" status to appear in the pending results list
- The modal uses z-index 50 to appear above other content
- Results are submitted for approval, not directly approved
- Approvers will review and approve the results

- No compilation warnings
- All imports resolved correctly

**READY FOR TESTING** ✅
