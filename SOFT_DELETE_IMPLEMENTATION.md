# Soft Delete Implementation - Complete

## Summary

Implemented soft delete functionality for user accounts. Users can now be disabled and re-enabled without permanently deleting data.

---

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Backend Changes

**1. Updated DELETE Endpoint** (`/server/src/routes/users.ts`)
- Changed from hard delete to soft delete
- Sets `is_active = false` instead of deleting record
- Returns updated user object
- Logs action in audit trail

**2. New Enable Endpoint** (`/server/src/routes/users.ts`)
- `POST /api/users/:id/enable`
- Re-enables disabled user accounts
- Sets `is_active = true`
- Returns updated user object

### ✅ Frontend Changes

**1. AppContext Functions** (`/context/AppContext.tsx`)
- `disableUser(userId, actor)` - Soft delete user
- `enableUser(userId, actor)` - Re-enable user
- Both functions log to audit trail

**2. UserManagement Component** (`/components/admin/UserManagement.tsx`)
- Added Disable button for active users
- Added Enable button for inactive users
- Confirmation dialogs before action
- Buttons show in Actions column

**3. API Client** (`/api/client.ts`)
- `deleteUser(id)` - Calls DELETE endpoint
- `enableUser(id)` - Calls POST enable endpoint

## UI Changes

### User Management Table

**Before:**
```
ID | Username | Role | Status | Actions
   |          |      |        | Edit Permissions
```

**After:**
```
ID | Username | Role | Status | Actions
   |          |      | Active | Edit | Disable
   |          |      |Inactive| Edit | Enable
```

### Action Buttons

- **Edit** (Blue) - Edit user permissions
- **Disable** (Red) - Disable active user account
- **Enable** (Green) - Enable disabled user account

---

## API Endpoints

### Disable User (Soft Delete)
```bash
DELETE /api/users/:id
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "message": "User account disabled successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 3,
    "username": "reception",
    "role": "RECEPTION",
    "is_active": false
  }
}
```

### Enable User
```bash
POST /api/users/:id/enable
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "message": "User account enabled successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 3,
    "username": "reception",
    "role": "RECEPTION",
    "is_active": true
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Disable User Test**
```
Before: is_active = true
DELETE /api/users/3
After: is_active = false
Status: ✅ PASS
```

✅ **Enable User Test**
```
Before: is_active = false
POST /api/users/3/enable
After: is_active = true
Status: ✅ PASS
```

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `/context/AppContext.tsx` | Added disableUser, enableUser functions |
| `/components/admin/UserManagement.tsx` | Added Disable/Enable buttons and handlers |
| `/server/src/routes/users.ts` | Changed DELETE to soft delete, added enable endpoint |
| `/api/client.ts` | Added enableUser method |

## Benefits of Soft Delete

1. **Data Preservation** - User data remains in database
2. **Audit Trail** - All actions logged for compliance
3. **Reversible** - Can re-enable accounts anytime
4. **Referential Integrity** - No broken foreign keys
5. **Compliance** - Meets data retention requirements
6. **Recovery** - Can restore accidentally disabled accounts

---

## Audit Logging

All actions are logged:

```
Disabled user account: reception.
Enabled user account: reception.
```

Logged in audit_logs table with:
- Actor username
- Action type (MANAGE_USERS)
- Description
- Timestamp

---

## Database Impact

### Before
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 3;
-- User record completely removed
```

### After
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_active = false WHERE id = 3;
-- User record preserved, just marked inactive
```

---

## User Experience

### Disable User Flow
1. Click "Disable" button next to user
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Click "OK" to confirm
4. User account disabled
5. Status changes to "Inactive"
6. "Disable" button changes to "Enable"

### Enable User Flow
1. Click "Enable" button next to user
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Click "OK" to confirm
4. User account enabled
5. Status changes to "Active"
6. "Enable" button changes to "Disable"

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Permission Check** - Only MANAGE_USERS permission can disable/enable
2. **Audit Trail** - All actions logged
3. **Confirmation** - User must confirm action
4. **Reversible** - Can be undone if mistake
5. **No Data Loss** - User data preserved

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations** - Disable/enable multiple users
2. **Scheduled Deletion** - Auto-delete after X days
3. **Restore History** - View who disabled/enabled user
4. **Reason Tracking** - Record reason for disabling
5. **Notifications** - Notify user when account disabled

---

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE AND TESTED**

All soft delete features working:
- Disable user ✅
- Enable user ✅
- UI buttons ✅
- Audit logging ✅
- Confirmation dialogs ✅

Ready for production use!
