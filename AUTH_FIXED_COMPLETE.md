# ✅ Authentication System - FIXED & COMPLETE

## Summary

Fixed the authentication system to properly match mock data with database users and roles. All users now have correct credentials and permissions.

---

## What Was Fixed

### ❌ Issues Found
1. Database had "admin" with SUDO role instead of "sudo"
2. Missing "phlebo" and "labtech" users
3. Password hashes were incorrect/mismatched
4. No delete user functionality
5. Role permissions not properly mapped

### ✅ Issues Resolved
1. ✅ Created "sudo" user with SUDO role
2. ✅ Created "admin" user with ADMIN role
3. ✅ Added "phlebo" (PHLEBOTOMY) and "labtech" (LAB) users
4. ✅ Generated correct bcrypt password hashes for all users
5. ✅ Added delete user endpoint
6. ✅ Verified all permissions are correctly mapped

}
```

### Updated API Client
```typescript
async deleteUser(id: number) {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/users/${id}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: getAuthHeaders(),
  });
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to delete user');
  return response.json();
}
```

## Testing Results

✅ **All Users Login Successfully**

```
sudo/sudo           → SUDO role ✅
admin/admin         → ADMIN role ✅
reception/reception → RECEPTION role ✅
phlebo/phlebo       → PHLEBOTOMY role ✅
labtech/labtech     → LAB role ✅
approver/approver   → APPROVER role ✅
```

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `/server/src/routes/users.ts` | Added DELETE endpoint |
| `/api/client.ts` | Added deleteUser() method |
| `/components/LoginScreen.tsx` | Updated test credentials |

---

## Database State

```sql
-- Current users in database
SELECT id, username, role FROM users ORDER BY id;

 id | username  |    role    
----+-----------+------------
  1 | sudo      | SUDO
  2 | admin     | ADMIN
  3 | reception | RECEPTION
  4 | phlebo    | PHLEBOTOMY
  5 | labtech   | LAB
  6 | approver  | APPROVER
```

## How to Use

### Login with Different Roles

```bash
# SUDO - Full Access
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"sudo","password":"sudo"}'

# ADMIN - Admin Subset
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}'

# RECEPTION
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"reception","password":"reception"}'
```

### Delete User

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5001/api/users/2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```
