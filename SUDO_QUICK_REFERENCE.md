## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Database Schema
Add new tables:
```sql
- organization_settings
- system_health_metrics
- user_activity_logs
- backup_history
- api_keys
- custom_reports
- audit_trail_detailed
```

### Step 2: Backend API Endpoints
Create new routes:
```
POST   /api/sudo/settings
GET    /api/sudo/settings
PATCH  /api/sudo/settings

GET    /api/sudo/health
GET    /api/sudo/activity-logs
GET    /api/sudo/backups
POST   /api/sudo/backups/create
POST   /api/sudo/backups/restore/:id

GET    /api/sudo/reports
POST   /api/sudo/reports
DELETE /api/sudo/reports/:id

GET    /api/sudo/api-keys
POST   /api/sudo/api-keys
DELETE /api/sudo/api-keys/:id
```

### Step 3: Frontend Components
Create new admin components:
```
components/admin/
├── SudoSettings.tsx
├── FinancialDashboard.tsx
├── UserActivityLog.tsx
├── BackupManagement.tsx
├── SystemHealth.tsx
├── BulkUserImport.tsx
├── CustomReportBuilder.tsx
├── AdvancedAuditTrail.tsx
└── ApiKeyManagement.tsx
```

### Step 4: Permission Checks
Add SUDO-only permission checks:
```typescript
if (user.role !== 'SUDO') {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'SUDO access required' });
}
```

## Security Considerations

✅ All SUDO features must:
- Check user role is SUDO
- Log all actions in audit trail
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Rate limit API endpoints
- Require confirmation for destructive actions

---

## Performance Considerations

⚡ Optimize for:
- Large datasets (millions of records)
- Real-time dashboards
- Scheduled jobs (backups, exports)
- Concurrent users
- Database query performance
